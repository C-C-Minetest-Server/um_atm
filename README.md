# ATM for Unified Money

This mod connects the [Currency mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/currency/) to [Unified Money](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/unified_money/) by providing an ATM for taking money out.

This mod is highly configurable; the configurations can be found in `settingtypes.txt`.

This mod is rewritten but inspired and taken textures from [ATM mod of LinuxForks Minetest Server](https://git.bananach.space/atm.git). The textures are released under WTFPL as seen in `textures.LICENSE`.
